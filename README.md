# ZMK support for the YamPAD
The goal of this project was to create wireless support for the YamPAD macropad using ZMK. The creator of the YamPAD originally intended wired compatability with QMK flashing. 

If you are not familiar with [ZMK](https://zmk.dev/docs) I highly suggest that you take a look at the documentation to familiarize yourself with the installation process. The YamPAD is not included in ZMK's list of supported shields, so we have to build our own firmare. I suggest following [this guide](https://zmk.dev/docs/development/new-shield) to accomplish this.

This repo contains all the necessary files to build the .uf2 file and flash it to the MCU. Once flashed, the macropad should be ready to use. You can use GitHub Actions from the ZMK repo to build your own firmware. If you run into issues with that, you could also create a [local build](https://zmk.dev/docs/development/setup) on your machine.

### Requirements
[YamPAD PCB](https://hackaday.io/project/163491-yampad-feature-packed-open-source-macropad)

[nice!nano](https://nicekeyboards.com/)

>Alternatives: [ProMicro NRF52840](https://github.com/joric/nrfmicro/wiki/Alternatives#ble-micro-pro)

I went with the ProMicro NRF52840

### Features
- Bluetooth
- OLED Display
- Keymap Layers (Modifiable)

RGB support is soon to be added

### Notes
- ZMK comes with it's own OLED configuration. Currently, their is not sufficient documentation to create custom displays. [See](https://zmk.dev/docs/features/displays)
- For wireless macropads, I suggest not having the OLED display because it will kill the battery. However, you could go with the [nice!view display](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-view) which has low power draw.
- Check for any hardware issues: diodes, switches, connections, etc.

The YamPAD is an open source macropad by [Mattia Dal Ben](https://github.com/mattdibi)

ZMK Firmware is an open source (MIT) keyboard firmware built on the [Zephyrâ„¢ Project](https://zephyrproject.org/) Real Time Operating System (RTOS). ZMK's goal is to provide a modern, wireless, and powerful firmware free of licensing issues.
